<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive university research group website, progressing from an MVP to a feature-rich application. The development was iterative, focusing on core functionality, then adding advanced features like an admin panel, authentication, and extensive content management. Significant effort was dedicated to integrating live data from Google Scholar and Scopus, overcoming API limitations (quota, author parsing), and ensuring robust role-based access control. UI/UX was refined based on user feedback, adopting an Apple-style design with Shadcn UI. Debugging involved fixing backend serialization, frontend rendering issues, and addressing persistent authentication token problems. Recent work included refining publications (Scopus API integration, manual entry), team management (status, roles, principal investigator profiles, duplicate photo fix), and dynamic site settings (logos, hero, about cards). The trajectory concluded mid-implementation of new features for Collaborators and Research Areas.
